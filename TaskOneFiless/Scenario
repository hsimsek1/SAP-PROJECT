After dominating the European luxury footwear market, Chausseur Élégant, a premium French shoe manufacturer, launched an aggressive North American expansion. The initial rollout surpassed expectations, with rapid retail partnerships established across major U.S. metropolitan areas. 

However, six months into operations, the CX team observed alarming patterns: a 217% spike in return rates from Texas and Florida locations, coupled with scathing social media reviews mentioning "glue failures" and "misaligned stitching" – issues completely antithetical to Élégant's 0.3% defect rate in Europe. 

You're now in a high-stakes meeting with their VP of North American Operations (formerly of Louis Vuitton) and Chief Quality Officer (ex-Hermès), who've intercepted three shipments containing suspiciously subpar materials. Their internal forensic team confirmed these weren't manufacturing defects, but rather sophisticated knockoffs entering through their Miami distribution hub. 

The board demands: (1) immediate geospatial analysis of counterfeit hotspots correlated with social sentiment, (2) supply chain vulnerability assessment focusing on third-party logistics partners, and (3) a blockchain-based authentication prototype for their premium line within 45 days. With $28M in projected Q4 revenue at risk and their Milan Fashion Week showcase approaching, every decision carries existential weight for this 93-year-old maison.
